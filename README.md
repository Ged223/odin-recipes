# odin-recipes

A simple recipe catalogue website made only with HTML, no CSS.

It's primary purpose is to strengthen my skills and memory with the foundations of HTML, before I move on to focus on learning other stuff.
It's secondary purpose is to hold my plant-based recipes that I personally cook and eat. For my own reference, and for sharing.
