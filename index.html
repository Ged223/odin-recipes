        Ideas to improve real-life usage:
        - Change title and headline "Odin" to something like "Straightforward" or "Simple"
        - add footer that declares that recipes contain 0 animal products.
        - publish on github pages, share link with my family. If they want to add any recipe, ask them to send me and I'll add.
        - Add localization (both English and Slovak versions of all recipes), selectable by clicking a flag on top.
        - Implement visual recipe categories on menu page.
